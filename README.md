# FLIMatch

FLIMatch is a Python toolkit for matching, comparing, and classifying
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) data across experiments,
conditions, or samples.

The package focuses on lifetime-domain similarity rather than raw
intensity, enabling robust comparison of FLIM measurements acquired
under varying photon counts, signal levels, or imaging conditions.

FLIMatch is designed for reproducible, quantitative analysis workflows
in biophysics and fluorescence microscopy.
